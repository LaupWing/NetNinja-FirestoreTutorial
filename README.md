Firebase is hosted in de cloud so you need a firebase account in order to use it. 

After loggin in you are greeted in with the control panel of firebase. On the left you can choose between the diffrent components that firebase offers. Testing

In the database panel you can choose between the cloud database (the newer version) or realtime database (the older version)

After selecting the preffered database service you can choose between the locked mode or the test mode. In the locked mode you can lock users from accesing the database, but in this case we need the test mode because we are in pre production mode. 

In the database panel we can add collections which stands for a collection of related info for example users.
